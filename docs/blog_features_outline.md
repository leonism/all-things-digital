# Blog Integration and Vue 3 Migration Outline

This document outlines the proposed strategy for integrating comprehensive blog functionalities into the existing Vite.js and TailwindCSS project, alongside a full migration of the frontend structure to Vue 3.

## Vue 3 Migration Strategy

The primary goal is a complete transition from the current EJS templating system to a modern frontend architecture based on Vue 3. This involves setting up Vue 3 within the existing Vite configuration (`vite.config.mjs`), leveraging Vite's native support for efficient Vue development. We will systematically replace EJS templates with reusable Vue components, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase. The existing JavaScript functionality, particularly related to the `vite-plugin-ejs`, will be carefully reviewed and refactored to align with Vue's component-based lifecycle and reactivity system. Throughout this migration, we will ensure that the existing TailwindCSS styles and design system are seamlessly integrated with the new Vue components, preserving the established visual identity.

## Blog Architecture and Content Management

We will implement a static site generation (SSG) approach for the blog, utilizing Markdown files for content creation and management. Blog posts will reside in a dedicated directory, such as `/src/content/posts/`, allowing for easy organization. Each Markdown file will contain frontmatter (using YAML syntax) at the beginning to define essential metadata like the post title, publication date, author, categories, tags, and a brief description for SEO purposes. During the Vite build process, these Markdown files will be parsed. We can utilize a Vite plugin specifically designed for Markdown (like `vite-plugin-md` potentially configured with frontmatter parsing) or develop a custom build script. This process will transform the Markdown content into HTML and extract the frontmatter metadata, generating a structured data source (e.g., a JSON file) that contains all posts and their associated information. This pre-processed data will be readily available for Vue components to consume, enabling fast page loads.

Vue Router will be configured to handle navigation within the blog section. Dynamic routes will be established for individual blog posts (e.g., `/blog/:slug`), category archive pages (e.g., `/blog/category/:categoryName`), and tag archive pages (e.g., `/blog/tag/:tagName`). These routes will utilize the pre-generated post data to display the relevant content dynamically.

## Feature Implementation Details

Specific Vue components will be developed to render the blog content. A `BlogPost.vue` component will display individual articles, rendering the parsed HTML content and associated metadata. A `BlogList.vue` component will present a paginated list of blog posts, potentially filterable or sortable. Dedicated components or views will also be created for category and tag archive pages, listing posts associated with the respective term based on the frontmatter metadata.

For search functionality, a client-side approach will be implemented. A search component (`BlogSearch.vue`) will utilize the pre-generated JSON data containing all post content and metadata. A lightweight JavaScript search library like `Fuse.js` or custom filtering logic will be employed to allow users to search through posts directly within their browser, providing instant results without server interaction.

Significant focus will be placed on implementing robust SEO features. We will use a library like `vue-meta` or Vue 3's built-in capabilities to dynamically update page titles and meta descriptions for each blog post and archive page, drawing information from the Markdown frontmatter. Open Graph (OG) tags will also be dynamically generated for improved social media sharing previews. Furthermore, structured data using JSON-LD schema (e.g., `BlogPosting`) will be embedded within the `BlogPost.vue` component to provide rich context for search engines. A `sitemap.xml` file, listing all blog posts and other key site pages, will be automatically generated during the build process using a Vite plugin or custom script. Similarly, an RSS feed (`rss.xml`) containing the latest blog posts will be generated during the build, allowing users to subscribe to updates.

To enable user interaction, a comment system will be integrated. Given the static nature of the site, a third-party commenting platform such as Giscus (leveraging GitHub Discussions), Disqus, or Commento will be embedded within the `BlogPost.vue` component. The specific choice can be discussed further, but Giscus aligns well with a GitHub-hosted project.

## Styling and Build Process

The existing TailwindCSS configuration and utility classes will be fully utilized to style the new Vue components, ensuring visual consistency with the rest of the application. The Vite build process will be configured to handle the Vue 3 compilation, Markdown parsing, data generation (JSON), asset optimization, and the creation of the static `sitemap.xml` and `rss.xml` files, resulting in a highly optimized static website.
