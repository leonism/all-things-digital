## Introduction

Welcome to the first blog post on this newly integrated Vue 3 blog! This post serves as an example to test the Markdown rendering and frontmatter extraction.

## Features

We are using:

*   **Vite:** For fast development and builds.
*   **Vue 3:** The progressive JavaScript framework.
*   **TailwindCSS:** For utility-first styling.
*   **Markdown:** For writing content.

## Code Example

```javascript
console.log("Hello from the blog post!");
```

This demonstrates how code blocks are rendered.
