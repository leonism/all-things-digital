This is the first example blog post generated for testing the Markdown processing and frontmatter structure. Welcome to the first blog post on this newly integrated Vue 3 blog! This post serves as an example to test the Markdown rendering and frontmatter extraction.

## Features

We are using:

* **Vite:** For fast development and builds.
* **Vue 3:** The progressive JavaScript framework.
* **TailwindCSS:** For utility-first styling.
* **Markdown:** For writing content.

### Why Use These Tools?

Each of these tools brings its own unique advantages:

* **Vite** allows us to take advantage of modern JavaScript features like ES modules while offering near-instantaneous hot module replacement (HMR) for a faster development experience.
* **Vue 3** introduces the Composition API, which provides more flexibility when structuring complex components, making it easier to scale applications.
* **TailwindCSS** gives developers the ability to style directly within their HTML, avoiding long CSS files and promoting reusability through utility classes.
* **Markdown** makes writing content simpler and cleaner by focusing on readability without losing the ability to add rich formatting.

## Code Example

```javascript
<template>
  <section id="blogArticles" class="flex flex-col">
    <BlogArticleCard
      v-for="post in publishedPosts"
      :key="post.slug"
      :imageSrc="post.featuredImage?.src || '/assets/img/thumbnail-01-comp.jpg'"
      :imageAlt="post.featuredImage?.alt || post.title"
      :title="post.title"
      :postLink="`/blog/${post.slug}`"
      :date="post.date"
      :excerpt="post.excerpt"
      :tags="post.tags"
      :authorImageSrc="post.author?.image || '/assets/img/avatar.png'"
      :authorImageAlt="post.author?.name || 'Author profile picture'"
      :authorName="post.author?.name || 'Unknown Author'"
      :category="post.category"
    />
  </section>
</template>

<script setup>
/**
 * BlogGrid Component
 *
 * This component displays a grid of blog posts using the `BlogArticleCard`
 * component. It fetches all posts from `blog-data.json` and filters them
 * to only show published posts.
 *
 * The component uses Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>` and a
 * computed property to handle the filtering logic.
 */
import { computed } from 'vue';
import BlogArticleCard from './BlogArticleCard.vue';
import postsData from '../../blog-data.json';

/**
 * Computed property that filters the imported `postsData` array
 * to include only posts where the `status` is 'published' or
 * where the `status` field is not present (assuming it's published by default).
 */
const publishedPosts = computed(() => {
  return postsData.filter(
    (post) => post.status === 'published' || !post.status,
  );
});
</script>

<style scoped>
/* Scoped styles for this component if any */
</style>

```

This demonstrates how code blocks are rendered. They can be used to include snippets of code in various programming languages, making it easy to share technical knowledge.

### Typography and Formatting

Markdown lets you format your text easily. Here’s an overview of common typographic elements:

#### Headings

You can create headings of different levels like this:

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Bold and Italics

Use double asterisks (`**`) for bold text and single asterisks (`*`) for italics. For example:

* **This is bold text.**
* *This is italicized text.*

#### Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are useful for quoting someone else's words or emphasizing important points.

#### Lists

Markdown supports both **unordered** and **ordered** lists:

* Unordered list item 1
* Unordered list item 2

  * Nested unordered list item

1. Ordered list item 1
2. Ordered list item 2

   1. Nested ordered list item

### Links and Images

You can easily insert links and images into your posts.

#### Link Example:

### Conclusion

In conclusion, this post showcases some of the capabilities of **Markdown**, demonstrating how it simplifies content creation while maintaining flexibility in formatting. By leveraging tools such as Vite, Vue 3, and TailwindCSS, we can build fast, scalable, and well-styled web applications with ease.

Feel free to experiment with this setup, and let us know what you think! Stay tuned for more updates as we continue refining our development process.

Happy coding!
