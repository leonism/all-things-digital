      And where do we begin? I think I’ve come a long way within the technological and creative sector. For the most
      part, I fell in love with computers in general and learnt various knowledge from the Internet.

      The sole purpose of having this blog was purely to document experimental projects while trying to adopt
      cutting-edge tech advancements. While it may not be the most perfect documentation, it might save you time when
      you’re trying to Google your error code.

      I’m also a self-taught developer who experiments with frontend frameworks, digital marketing strategies, machine
      learning, and organic SERP through SEO methods. Hope you enjoy reading my documentation!
