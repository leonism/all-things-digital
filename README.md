## üéä Descriptions

Introducing our newest CSS theme: `All Things Digital`, a simple, minimalistic and responsive multiple-page layout, built on top of the latest Tailwind (3.4.17) technology. `All Things Digital` shipped with Dark Mode and Mobile First Focus! This theme is designed to provide a sleek and modern look for your website or blogs, with a focus on accessibility and easy customization.

The dark mode feature allows users to switch to a darker color scheme for a more comfortable viewing experience, particularly at night or in low light environments. And with a mobile first focus, this theme is optimized for mobile devices, ensuring that your website looks great on any screen size.

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework, which means that it provides a set of low-level utility classes that make it easy to style your website without writing complex CSS code. This allows you to quickly and easily customize the look and feel of your website to match your brand and aesthetic.

In addition to the sleek dark mode and mobile first focus, our Tailwind CSS theme also includes powerful plugins for typography and forms. The typography plugin allows you to easily add beautiful and highly customizable headings, paragraphs, and other text elements to your website. And the forms plugin makes it easy to create clean and user-friendly forms for gathering information from your visitors.

Together, these plugins provide a complete solution for styling your website's content and gathering information from your users. They're built to work seamlessly with the rest of the theme, so you can easily create a professional and cohesive look for your website.

Whether you're a seasoned web developer or a beginner, this theme is sure to provide a professional and modern look for your website. Try it out today!

## ü§ì How To

### 1. Install dependencies

Install all required packages for development:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the development server

This project uses Vite for fast development and hot module replacement. To start the Vite dev server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will serve your project locally and watch for changes in your source files.

### 3. Watch and build Tailwind CSS

To continuously compile your Tailwind CSS as you work, open a separate terminal and run:

```bash
npm run watch
```

This command uses Tailwind CLI to watch ./src/main.css and output the compiled CSS to ./dist/style.css whenever you make changes.

### 4. Build for production

When you're ready to build your site for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate an optimized build of your site using Vite.

### 5. Preview the production build

To locally preview your production build (after running npm run build):

```bash
npm run preview
```

### 6. Serve the built site with Live Server

If you want to serve the static `dist/` folder using Live Server (helpful for static hosting or testing):

```bash
npm start
```

### 7. Compress CSS for production

To generate a minified CSS file for production, run:

```bash
npm run compress
```

**Customization**: You can edit the scripts in `package.json` and the `tailwind.config.js` file to change input/output locations or tweak build commands as needed for your workflow.

Summary of scripts:

- `dev` : Start Vite development server.
- `build` : Build the site for production.
- `preview` : Preview the production build locally.
- `watch` : Watch and compile Tailwind CSS during development.
- `compress` : Minify Tailwind CSS for production.
- `start` : Serve the dist folder with Live Server.
