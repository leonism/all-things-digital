## ü§ì How To

### 1. Install dependencies

Install all required packages for development:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the development server

This project uses Vite for fast development and hot module replacement. To start the Vite dev server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will serve your project locally and watch for changes in your source files.

### 3. Watch and build the Project

To continuously compile your Tailwind CSS as you work, open a separate terminal and run:

```bash
npm run watch
```

This command uses Tailwind CLI to watch ./src/main.css and output the compiled CSS to ./dist/style.css whenever you make changes.

### 4. Build for production

When you're ready to build your site for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate an optimized build of your site using Vite.

### 5. Preview the production build

To locally preview your production build (after running npm run build):

```bash
npm run preview
```

### 6. Serve the built site with Live Server

If you want to serve the static `dist/` folder using Live Server (helpful for static hosting or testing):

```bash
npm start
```

### 7. Compress CSS for production

To generate a minified CSS file for production, run:

```bash
npm run compress
```

**Customization**: You can edit the scripts in `package.json` and the `tailwind.config.js` file to change input/output locations or tweak build commands as needed for your workflow.

Summary of scripts:

- `dev` : Start Vite development server.
- `build` : Build the site for production.
- `preview` : Preview the production build locally.
- `watch` : Watch and compile Tailwind CSS during development.
- `compress` : Minify Tailwind CSS for production.
- `start` : Serve the dist folder with Live Server.
- `standardize-frontmatter` : Standardize frontmatter field order across all posts.
- `process-frontmatter` : Process and enhance frontmatter in markdown files.
- `generate-blog-data` : Generate blog data JSON from markdown files.
